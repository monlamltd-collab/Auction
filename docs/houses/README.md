# Per-house dossiers

One markdown dossier per auction house — the **slug-keyed home** for a house's full
handling story: config pointers, the *why* behind each choice, known quirks, incident
history, and a last-verified date. It complements (does not duplicate) the other layers:

- **Code** (`lib/houses.js`, `lib/scraper/house-recognisers.js`, `lib/scraper/recall-sentinels.js`,
  the recogniser fns) is the authoritative runtime config — the dossier *links to* it.
- **`house_skills`** (DB) holds runtime engine/health metrics.
- **Claude auto-memory** holds cross-cutting themes.

The dossier is the human/AI-readable per-house record none of those own. It exists so a
future session (or a teammate) can read one page instead of grepping the slug across five
files. Consult the relevant dossier **first** when touching a house.

## Lifecycle
- **Created at onboarding** — `auction-conventions` → `references/new-house-playbook.md` **Step 6.5**
  requires a dossier (+ a row here) when a new house is added.
- **Updated on every heal** — `auction-self-healing` §6 LEARN loop requires appending the
  incident (date → root cause → fix PR) to the house's dossier.

## Backlog
The long tail of ~170 houses don't yet have dossiers. They can be backfilled incrementally
(every heal/onboarding adds one going forward). A useful seed for the Cat-B per-auction URL
patterns is `.planning/milestones/auction-watcher/HOUSE-CLASSIFICATION.md` (a one-off 2026-04-24
registry — verify against current code before trusting it).
